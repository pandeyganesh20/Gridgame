# Gridgame

//GANESH PANDEY

This is the project related with the javascript. Also, this is the first time I have implemented javascript.

In my project entitled"CS 313 Grid Game", the major target of player is to accomplish the all 3 levels. Upon running the project, first level appears. So, the rule to get to next level are:

a) For level 1, you have to find 4 even no
   in the 4*4 grid,   with 7 or less click.
 
b) For level 2, you have to find 5 even no
    in the 4*4 grid,  with 8 or less click.

c) For level 3, you have to find 6 even no    in the 4*4 grid, with 9 or less click.

If you complete all level then you are winner, but upon inability to  complete any of the step , game is over and level 1 is started.

Implementation:

In the game, I change 8*8 grid to 4*4 and added two different button named "Level 2" and Level 3 , which are basically the keys selected once you completed the level. Also, the reset function has been added with level one , once you reset it is directed to level one.  Moreover, score is shown above the grid . It is shown through the set Status text.

Firstly, you are in the level one. All the grids are filled with the predefined array's element and function called"doit". Then , in the no of steps that is defined, if you complete it will show message for pressing level 2. 
Once you press level 2, you will have different set of numbers . If the condition is completed for winning, then it gives message to press level 3.
Finally, level 3 is the last level, with the condition to find more no of even no. If you met the requirement, user win the entire game.
Uponn failing on accomplishing any of the requirement in the pre-defined move, game is over.

The project runs sucessfully and all the steps works. Most coding help are done by professor, a very warm thanks to professor.Finally,enjoy the game.
